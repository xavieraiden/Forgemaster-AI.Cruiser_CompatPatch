<![CDATA[
Obviously, patch after both AI.Cruisers and Forgemaster. Also obviously, this mod requires both of those mods to be installed.

Currently just fixes the crew blacklist for the Saline Hull Body modular hull augment.

If there is anything else I should add/change let me know. I probably don't know the full extent of the compat issues these mods have.

This mod will not add any new content, it will only fix incompatibilities between the mods. And all credit and Kudos go to the teams behind: FTL Multiverse, Forgemaster, and Rogue AI Cruisers. Not to mention the team at Subset Games for making such a great game in the first place.

		Suggestions for the description...

		Write a short paragraph about the mod's effect first (what style ship, how
		does it affect gameplay). No need to introduce yourself.

		Optionally add a paragraph of background flavor.

		Optionally list important features.

		List any concerns about mod compatibility, preferred order, or requirements.

		Mention "Replaces the XYZ ship." if relevant.
			Kestrel-A, Engi-A,    Fed-A,     Zoltan-A,
			Stealth-A, Rock-A,    Slug-A,    Mantis-A,
			Lanius-A,  Crystal-A

		Above all, keep the description general, so you won't have to edit
		that again for each new version.
