## Obviously, patch after both Rogue AI Cruisers and Forgemaster. Also obviously, this mod requires both of those mods to be installed.


Currently just fixes the crew blacklist for the Saline Hull Body modular hull augment.

If there is anything else I should add/change let me know. I probably don't know the full extent of the compat issues these mods have.

This mod will not add any new content, it will only fix incompatibilities between the mods. And all credit and Kudos go to the teams behind: FTL Multiverse, Forgemaster, and Rogue AI Cruisers. Not to mention the team at Subset Games for making such a great game in the first place.
